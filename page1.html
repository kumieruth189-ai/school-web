    <h1>css part 1</h1>
    <div style=" background-color: white; color: black;">
        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language, most commonly HTML. CSS code dictates how elements like colors, fonts, layouts, and positioning should appear on various media (screen, print, etc.).</p>
    </div >
    <div  style=" background-color:#0b0d17; color:  #ffffff;">
        <p>Separation of Concerns: CSS allows developers to separate the structure and content of a web page (defined in HTML) from its visual design. This makes the content more accessible, easier to maintain, and provides more flexibility for design changes.</p>
    </div>
    <div style=" background-color:#f2f2f2; color:  #2c2c2c;">
        <p>Cascading: The "cascading" aspect refers to a predictable priority scheme that determines which style declaration is applied when multiple rules conflict. Styles can originate from the browser's default settings, user preferences, or the developer's style sheets, with more specific or later rules generally taking precedence.</p>
    </div>
    <div style=" background-color:#ffff4f; color:  #000063;">
        <p>Syntax: CSS is rule-based. Each rule (or ruleset) consists of a selector and a declaration block.
        Selector: Targets the specific HTML elements to be styled (e.g., h1 for all level one headings, .intro for elements with the class "intro", or #main-nav for the element with the ID "main-nav").
        Declaration Block: Contained within curly braces {} and contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.</p>
    </div>
